## Description

The Infinity Bowl is a fully automated, 3D-printed feeding and watering system for pets, designed to elevate both pet wellness and home convenience.

Built with Arduino-based sensing, real plumbing integration, and IoT-style data serving, it combines modern aesthetics with everyday practicality.

I created this project to eliminate the two major pain points in pet care: dirty stagnant bowls and the tedious daily refilling cycle.

The Infinity Bowl ensures constant access to fresh, flowing water and ready food, while minimizing manual maintenance.

Built-in safety features—including an overflow drain directly plumbed to the sewer—protect your home from valve malfunctions or water accidents.

Smart, clean, and worry-free, the Infinity Bowl blends seamlessly into any modern space with its minimalist pull-out drawer design and integrated monitoring system.
